        <div class="subheading mb-5">First Year Pre-Business Majorüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Ryan Shahidi and I am a first year pre-business major attending University of California, Riverside. I was born in Newport Beach, California, and I moved to Toronto when I was very young and lived there until grade school. Come first grade, I moved to Irvine and have been living there and attending Irvine schools from first grade all the way until 12th grade. I wanted to continue living in southern California as I have become accustomed to the style of life here and frankly I am a big fan of the weather. That is what led me to attending University of California, Riverside and I have greatly enjoyed my time here since. <br><br>

        For all of my childhood and a big part of my teenage years, I participated in organized sports. This included swimming, soccer, basketball, and football. My favorite of these ever since I was a child was soccer, and basketball was my clear second favorite. I enjoyed swimming and football for the most part, but it was hard for me to get into because I didn‚Äôt actually watch the sports outside of my participation. I still enjoy keeping up with soccer and basketball, but specifically soccer. My favorite parts about these sports were getting to know your teammates and what they were good at and not so good at, and enduring a whole season of many ups and downs with those teammates. 
<br><br>

        My first and only job was at H&M as a sales associate. I enjoyed this job mainly because I got along pretty well with my coworkers considering that most of them were relative in age to me. My job mostly consisted of folding, organizing, and displaying clothes, along with working to help customers whether that be finding clothes or assisting them at the register. What I had to do was mainly related to the shift that I had that day. If I had ‚Äútruck shift‚Äù, which starts at 6 am, I was responsible for either ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù or ‚Äúrunning‚Äù. Processing consisted of opening shipment containers that we received twice a week, laying out the clothes on a table, and then hanging up the clothes on rolling racks that we called ‚Äúponies‚Äù. The challenging part was learning where everything had to go and organizing to make it easier for the runners. Running consisted of taking these ponies and hanging up the clothes where they belonged. If I had a normal daytime shift, I would typically either be running, at the register, or operating the fitting rooms. If I had a closing shift, which was either ending at 11 pm or 12pm, depending on the day of the week, I would do normal daytime activities until the store closed, and then for about an hour after we closed, I would be in charge of going through a specific department and making sure everything was in order. This included picking up clothes, organizing and reorganizing the clothes, and putting clothes which don't belong on ponies that were sorted by department.
